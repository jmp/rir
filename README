rir
===

This is a very simple IRC bot. You can control it by either sending a PRIVMSG to
it, or by addressing it by its nickname on a channel. Everything you send to the
bot will be sent raw to the IRC server. For example:

    rir: JOIN #eggs

This tells the bot to send "JOIN #eggs" to the IRC server. To send messages to
channels or other users, use the standard PRIVMSG syntax:

    rir: PRIVMSG bill :you stink
    rir: PRIVMSG #eggs :my omelette is delicous

The only predefined command is "die" or "quit". This will kill the bot:

    rir: die

It should be relatively simple to add your own commands, triggers, and so on.
